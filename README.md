# AppliedMaths-WithScilab
 Scilab practicals for applied mathematics concepts.
 
This series of practicals in applied mathematics, using Scilab, covers key topics such as linear, parabolic, and cubic interpolation, numerical integration with rectangle, trapezoidal, and Simpson methods, as well as solving first- and second-order differential equations. It also explores approximate solutions to nonlinear equations using three classic methods: bisection, false position, and Newton's method. The goal is to facilitate learning and practical application of essential concepts in applied mathematics.
