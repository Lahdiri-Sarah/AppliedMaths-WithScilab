# AppliedMaths-WithScilab
 Scilab practicals for applied mathematics concepts.
 
This repository contains a series of practical exercises in applied mathematics (MAP) for first-year students at UGA. It is designed to explore the relationship between mathematics and its applications using Scilab, a powerful programming tool. The topics covered include:

**Interpolation:** linear, parabolic, and cubic.
**Numerical Integration:** rectangle, trapezoidal, and Simpson methods.
**Solving Differential Equations:** first- and second-order equations.
**Approximate Solutions to Nonlinear Equations:**
Bisection method.
False position method.
Newton's method.
This series of practicals offers an interesting way to connect mathematical theory with real-world applications through programming.
